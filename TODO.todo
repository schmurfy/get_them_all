- improve logging
- add more documentation
- replace hpricot with nokogiri ?
  hpricot may be more capable when parsing invalid html.

known issues:
- cookies passing (authentication)
- activesupport notification system is nice but... global to 
  the running application, so every crawler will have the same extensions
